      "abstract": "Water management is a major issue in agriculture, particularly for small-scale farms that frequently confront resource limits and changing environmental circumstances. Implementing a smart irrigation system using IoT devices has various advantages but also presents some problems. The purpose of the study was to create a smart irrigation system that uses IoT sensors and machine learning algorithms to optimize water usage in small-scale farms, decreasing waste while increasing crop output. The suggested system uses IoT sensors to monitor soil moisture and meteorological conditions, with data processed in real time via edge computing. Machine learning methods, notably Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), are trained to anticipate optimal irrigation schedules using gathered data. The system design incorporates connection infrastructure that enables seamless data transmission and real-time decision-making. Preliminary field studies on a small-scale tomato farm showed a 25% boost in crop output and a 35% reduction in water usage while using the smart irrigation system. The results illustrate the efficacy of merging the Internet of Things and machine learning. The smart irrigation system developed in this study efficiently optimizes water utilization in agriculture, making it a feasible alternative for small-scale farmers confronting water constraint. This study advances the field of precision agriculture by proving the practical use of IoT and machine learning in smart irrigation systems as a main contribution."

      "abstract": "In the agriculture sector, various difficulties include resource depletion, workforce deficiencies, and climate change. Outdated IOT assembled resolutions for conservation in powering and observing farming operations, but still impose an enormous amount of human engagement. Now, we familiarize Agri Nexus, a cutting-edge IoT-powered self-sufficient ecosystem that trusts blockchain, edge computing, artificial intelligence, and drone technology. Agri Nexus's energetic resource allocation, modernized farm management, and predictive analytics have made real-time decision-making possible. This technique originates significantly in pesticide routines while augmenting yield proficiency by using drones operational with biosensors for scattered insect control and crop fitness monitoring. By reducing latency and enhancing real-time processing, edge computing succeeds in faster responses to environmental changes. Furthermore, supplies are nontoxic and translucent to blockchain-based smart contracts. On a 50-acre smart farm, our pilot research has shown a 40% reduction in pesticide use, a 25% boost in crop output, and a 30% lessening in water use. The decisions suggest that Agri Nexus meets a transformative approach to workable and independent agriculture, demanding minimal human intervention while exploiting efficiency. Upcoming efforts goals to augment AI models and enlarge blockchain claims for broader scalability. Agri Nexus indicates a significant bound toward self-sustaining, data-driven agricultural ecosystems that elevate efficiency and sustainability."

      "abstract": "This study explores the deployment of Private 5G networks in smart agriculture to enhance productivity and sustainability through the integration of traditional farming with advanced technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), Artifical Intelligence (AI), and big data analytics. These technologies enable precise monitoring and management of agricultural activities, but rural connectivity challenges often hinder their full potential. By implementing Private 5G networks with local edge computing, we achieve reliable, high-speed connectivity in remote areas, processing all data locally at the edge to minimize latency and bandwidth usage. The Mobile Network Operator (MNO) backhaul is used solely for regulatory heartbeat messages to the Spectrum Access System (SAS) under Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) rules, without relying on cloud services for data processing. Real-world measurements demonstrate that Private 5G offers superior signal quality (reference signal received power and reference signal received quality) and significantly higher throughput, making it a robust solution for optimizing agricultural practices and reducing environmental impact."

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) significantly influences the advancement of smart infrastructure systems in civil and agricultural engineering. IoT technologies have reshaped the management of urban infrastructure and agricultural operations through real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and automated control. In civil engineering, IoT sensors help monitor structural integrity, environmental conditions, and urban utilities, enhancing safety and efficiency in areas like traffic and waste management. IoT enhances agriculture through precision farming methods, including automatic irrigation, monitoring of crop and soil health, and resource optimization, leading to sustainable practices and increasing yields. This study analyzes IoT applications in rural and remote areas, focusing on the integration and challenges of IoT deployment. This also employs a case study approach to analyze IoT applications, highlighting key technological, economic, and policy challenges in remote and rural regions where connectivity and integration are critical. The findings suggest that IoT-driven infrastructure improves efficiency, sustainability, and resilience, but require more comprehensive analysis and integration in remote and rural areas. Future possibilities for IoT are discussed, focusing on advancements in edge computing, the use of renewable energy, and the development of smart rural infrastructure that meets both urban and agricultural needs. The paper urges for ongoing research and supportive policies that optimize the potential of IoT-integrated infrastructure systems, which are expected to improve efficiency, sustainability, and resilience in both sectors."

      "abstract": "An Ontology-Based Smart Irrigation System is presented in this research with the goal of improving agricultural water management. The main issue discussed is the inefficiency of conventional irrigation techniques, which results in water waste and lower crop yields. The process used entails creating an ontology, which includes defining concepts, establishing relationships, identifying domains, and populating the ontology. In order to facilitate real-time monitoring and decision-making, the irrigation system also incorporates sensors, actuators, and data processing algorithms. The main conclusions show that the ontology-based approach boosts crop output, encourages sustainable farming practices, and enhances water consumption efficiency. The findings of this study imply that ontology-based smart irrigation systems present a viable way to deal with the problems associated with water scarcity, improve agricultural output, and reduce their negative effects on the environment. The research adds to the expanding corpus of information on intelligent irrigation systems and emphasizes the significance of implementing cutting-edge technologies for agriculture's sustainable water management."
